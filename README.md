### Hello there!

My name is Aaron, and I'm currently looking for new work opportunities. I'm a full-stack web developer with over 10 years of experience. I primarily write Ruby on Rails and React code, but I'm open to any and all web technologies!

I'm seeking a role that allows me to continue honing my skills in building robust, scalable web applications while also providing opportunities for growth and innovation. I'm particularly interested in working with modern technologies that complement Ruby on Rails, allowing me to continue growing my skillset. I'm also interested in growing my leadership through mentorship opportunities.

In terms of industries, I'm open to a any sector, as long as there are complex challenges with the potential for impactful solutions. I thrive in highly collaborative environments that value knowledge sharing among team members, where I can both contribute my expertise and learn from others.

When it comes to software development practices, I value agile methodologies and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. I enjoy working in environments where there's a focus on pair programming to ensure higher code quality and minimize critical bugs. Additionally, I appreciate companies that prioritize work-life balance and offer opportunities for professional development and career advancement.
